##Sumaiya Mim – Portfolio Website🌐

This is my personal portfolio website created to showcase my skills, projects, and basic information as a beginner web developer.  
The website reflects a clean, simple, and modern design converted from a Figma prototype into a live website using HTML and CSS.

📲Design Process
- Portfolio UI was first designed using **Figma**
- The design was then converted into HTML and CSS and JS
- But due to many restrictions and lack of knowledge I could'nt duplicate the whole Figma prototype rather changed it for better
- Focus was kept on simplicity and readability

🧾What I Learned
- Building a complete portfolio website from scratch
- Converting Figma designs into real websites
- Using CSS Flexbox for layout
- Hosting websites using GitHub Pages

🎓Future Improvements
- Improve accessibility
- Add more projects
- Optimize for performance
